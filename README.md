# sop-latex-template
A LaTeX template I used for my various statements while applying for graduate studies. You can use it for a Statement of Purpose, a Personal History Statement, an Academic and Professional Goals Statement, and more.

This template is inspired by [Swapnil Gandhi's template](https://github.com/Swapnil-Gandhi/SoP-Template).

Here is how the main content looks (references are optional, and usually not added in SOPs):

Here is how footers look:

School specific macros can be changed in a single file, to make things easier while editing your SOP for other applications.

```latex
