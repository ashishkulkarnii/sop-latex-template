# sop-latex-template
A LaTeX template I used for my various statements while applying for graduate studies. You can use it for a Statement of Purpose, a Personal History Statement, an Academic and Professional Goals Statement, and more.

This template is inspired by [Swapnil Gandhi's template](https://github.com/Swapnil-Gandhi/SoP-Template).
